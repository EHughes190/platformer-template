# platformer-template

A skeleton for a 2D platformer created using vanilla JS. This project is to be used as a starting point or a simple documentation of how you could build a js game using HTML canvas.

This project includes a JS version as a well as a TS version. To use either, clone down the project, and navigate into one of the folders. Launch the index.html file (I prefer using the live server extension for VS Code) and have a play around using w,a,d keys.
